      <h1 class="post-title">Know Yourself AI – A Personal Tool for Clarity</h1>
      <p class="post-meta">By Ward Hasan · July 2025</p>

      <section class="post-content">
        <p>This wasn’t just a weekend project. It was born out of a feeling — a weird mix of being overwhelmed by thoughts and wanting to sit with them. So, I started building a tool I personally needed: <strong>Know Yourself AI</strong>.</p>

        <p>A lightweight, no-login, no-judgment assistant that lets you talk to yourself — with a little help from GPT.</p>

        <h2>🎯 The Idea</h2>
        <p>I didn’t want a chatbot that gives life advice. I wanted a mirror — something that reflects back your own thoughts, nudges you, and helps you connect dots you didn’t realize were scattered.</p>

        <p>So, I wrote a system message: <code>You are a thoughtful, reflective assistant...</code> — and that’s where it began.</p>

        <h2>⚙️ The Tech Stack</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS</li>
          <li><strong>Backend:</strong> FastAPI + Uvicorn</li>
          <li><strong>Security Layer:</strong> A custom-built proxy API using FastAPI</li>
          <li><strong>AI:</strong> OpenAI’s GPT-4 API</li>
          <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> slowapi (FastAPI wrapper)</li>
          <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> GitHub Pages (Frontend) + Render (Proxy & Backend)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🛡️ Security First</h2>
        <p>The biggest challenge wasn’t the prompt. It was <em>protecting the key</em>.</p>

        <p>We decided early on that the OpenAI API key should never touch the frontend. Instead, we built a <strong>secure FastAPI backend</strong> and placed a <strong>proxy API layer</strong> between the frontend and the OpenAI service.</p>

        <p>Here’s what we did:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Disabled /docs and /openapi endpoints</li>
          <li>✅ Added per-IP rate limiting (5 requests/min)</li>
          <li>✅ Used a <code>X-Frontend-Secret</code> header to validate the source of requests</li>
          <li>✅ Prevented direct access to backend — only the proxy can talk to it</li>
          <li>✅ Custom 404s for anyone poking around</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🌍 Deploying with Peace of Mind</h2>
        <p>The frontend lives on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, styled with simplicity. The backend and proxy are both hosted on <strong>Render</strong> using their free tier (shoutout to them for making security-friendly deployments that simple).</p>

        <p>Oh, and no frameworks on the frontend. We wanted everything to feel native, personal, and light.</p>

        <h2>💡 Lessons Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>🚧 Rate limits are not optional. Even for toy projects.</li>
          <li>🔐 Never expose secrets — not even once.</li>
          <li>🧠 Reflection is tech-enabled, but it has to be designed right. Prompt engineering is UX too.</li>
          <li>📦 A little proxy goes a long way.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This wasn’t just a tool. It was a mental health project disguised as a coding sprint.</p>

        <p><strong>Know Yourself AI drops tomorrow.</strong> Quietly. Without a launch party. But with a lot of heart.</p>

        <p>If you ever needed a moment to sit with your thoughts, maybe this can help.</p>
